Listens for data changes at a particular location.

This is the primary way to read data from a Database. Your callback will be triggered for the initial data and again whenever the data changes. Invoke the returned unsubscribe callback to stop receiving updates. [See | Retrieve Data on the Web](@link https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/read-and-write) for more details.

An onChildChanged event will be triggered when the data stored in a child (or any of its descendants) changes. Note that a single child_changed event may represent multiple changes to the child. The DataSnapshot passed to the callback will contain the new child contents. For ordering purposes, the callback is also passed a second argument which is a string containing the key of the previous sibling child by sort order, or null if it is the first child.

@param ref — The location to read from.

@param callback
A callback that fires when the specified event occurs. The callback will be passed a DataSnapshot.

@param options optional, whether to remove the listener after its first invocation. 

@returns — A function that can be invoked to remove the listener.

A callback that fires when the specified event occurs. The callback will be passed a DataSnapshot.

@param cancelCallback
An optional callback that will be notified if your event subscription is ever canceled because your client does not have permission to read this data (or it had permission but has now lost it). This callback will be passed an Error object indicating why the failure occurred.

@param options optional, whether to remove the listener after its first invocation. 

@returns — A function that can be invoked to remove the listener.
